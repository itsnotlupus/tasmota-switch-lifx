# tasmota-switch-lifx

A Berry driver for Tasmota that lets you control LIFX lights from your switch over Wi-Fi.  
This was written to be used on a rocker paddle switch running in detached mode (`SetOption73 1`) with multipress enabled (`SetOption13 0`)

WIP. This is a thin excuse for me to learn a bit about this tech stack.

This is developed and only tested on a MartinJerry RP-S01 1-gang switch preflashed with Tasmota 13.0.  
I'm reasonably confident it should work on other push button devices running Tasmota 13 or newer.

It is unclear whether this would work out of the box with a Switch-based device.

Anyway. Screenshots!
