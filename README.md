# tasmota-switch-lifx

A Berry driver for Tasmota that lets you configure which LIFX lights should be directly toggled on/off by button presses.

WIP. This is a thin excuse for me to learn a bit about this tech stack.

This is developed and only tested on a MartinJerry RP-S01 1-gang switch preflashed with Tasmota 13.0

Anyway. Screenshots!
